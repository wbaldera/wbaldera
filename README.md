**wbaldera/wbaldera** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

.. outside of work...my coaching. There are 3 entities I coach with at the moment; The Trinamics Sports Club a triathlon club that provides group training and a buddy system for those who do not want to train solo on the roads of Cayman; The Mustang Track Club the biggest youth running club on the Island and the John Gray High School Swim Club the kids of the main public high school.

I recently moved the Trinamics Club website over to a Stack App platform but because the host was looking to charge us more than we could pay and it didn't offer an easy migration path from wordpress. I would like to take the opportunity to develop it into a couple of different repos: one for the club themselves a demo instance, one for the frontend, and one for the backend. Hopefully this makes it easier for people to suggest some ideas (in the form of a pull request, of course).
